		<h1>First Journal Entry</h1>
		
		<p> 9/22 Last class (9/19) we created a photo on Github and liked our Sublime Text code to them. It is really cool to be able to look up my own website online, even though there are nothing but Gifs and images on it. </p>
		<p> The steps to update my website online: </p>

		<ul>
			
			<li> First, open your terminal and navigate to your folder by typing "cd ./desktop/JoseSebas2023.github.io"</li>
			<li> Then we add our changes by typing "git add ."</li>
			<li> Commit changes by adding a message that describes your changes by typing "git commit -m "your message""</li>
			<li> Finally you launch online by typing "git push"</li>
		</ul>

	<h1> Second Journal Entry </h1>

	<p>9/26 Today we went over everthing we have learned thusfar this year. In case I forget anything, here is the link to a slideshow with all the code we learned: bit.ly/cs1-slides . We also made our person cards and linked them to our websites. Here is the link to mine: https://codepen.io/JoseSebas2023/pen/zYyjYdK

	<p> Although the issue of my website not showing up online was resolved, the link to my journal page still doesn't work. </p>

	<p>We also made our first project. Basically its just a bunch of bright boxes that hurt your eyes and change colors when you hover over them. </p>

	</p>

	<!-- end of second entry -->

	<h1> Third Journal Entry </h1>

	<p>10/3 Today we worked on an animation project and put our updated websites on github. I did a soccer ball on fire moving acrossed the screen and getting bigger as it does. 
	</p>

	<!-- end of third entry -->
	<h1> Fourth Journal Entry </h1>

	<p>10/6 Today we worked for the whole class. I updated my projects and aboutme page. Next class Ms. Joesphs is putting our websites on the class page so I have some work to do over the weeking to finish everthing up. </p>
	
	<!-- end of fourth entry -->

	<h1> Fifth Journal Entry </h1>

	<p>10/13 I sketched out a plan for my halloween jumpscare project. I'm going to make the user tap on a house door for trick or treating and when the door opens a scary clown comes out. Although I don't have a lot of code for the project yet I linked it to my projects page. </p>

	<!-- end of fifth entry -->

	<h1> Sixth Journal Entry </h1>
	<p>10/24 I was out last class because I was sick but I'm still not really behind because I already coded my jumpscare. Some other big news that I learned when I came back to school is that Jonthan joined our class which is hype. Its great to have someone in class who is actually good at computer science.</p>

	<p>In class we refined our jump scares. Mine is a house with text that says "click to trick or treat" but when you click a creepy clown appears and does an evil laugh. At home I worked on centering the clown when it appeared because it isn't as scary when it shows up on the side. I also tried many times to have the text change to "BOO!" when the clown appears, but I still don't know how. </p>

	<!-- end of sixth entry -->

	<h1> Seventh Journal Entry </h1>
	<p>10/27 In class we continued working on our jumpscares. I explained what it is in the last journal entry but now I will explain the code behind it. In my jumpscare, I have two divs, one for the trick or treat house and the other for the clown. I also have an event listener that changes that plays a clown laugh and changes the clown's opacity to 1 when the screen is clicked (the user will click the screen because there is text at the top that says "click to trick or treat"). </p>

	<p> In class we also watched Ms. Joseph's video on event listeners. Here are 3 of my questions about event listeners:</p>


	<ul>
		<li> What are all the different types of events? </li>
		<li> How do you determine whether the event listener applies for the whole code or just a part of it? </li>
		<li> Is an event listener basically just a if ___ then ___ function? (like in Scratch) </li>
	</ul>

<!-- end of seventh entry -->

<h1> Eighth Journal Entry </h1>
	<p>11/10 We used javascript to make a fourth project. I made a project about soccer balls that appear at every .5 second interval and disapear if you hover over them with your mouse. Soon we will be starting gratitude cards. Basically we just code something that says we are greatful for someone and send it to them. I'll probably make one for my parents.  </p>

<!-- end of eighth entry -->

	<h1> Ninth Journal Entry </h1>
	<p>11/14 A function in code is a recipe that does something. We define it by saying function name (input){output} </p>
	<p>I barely had time to start my graditude card because I was taking the 
	AMC10 for most of the class time. I couldn't answer more than half the questions and I honestly almost fell asleep. </p>

<!-- end of ninth entry -->

	<h1> Tenth Journal Entry </h1>
	<p>11/22 Today I worked on my gratitude card which is based on the trips to Peru my dad took me on. Everytime a key is pushed, a different photo from our trips comes up. In the background is a picture of the peruvian flag and instructions on how to see the photos. The first time you click, the peruvian national anthem starts playing. </p>
	<p> I also edited my fourth project which is mentioned in my eight journal entry. Now when you hover over a soccer ball, a different one shows up. Before the original soccer ball would just disappear. </p>

	<h1> Eleventh Journal Entry </h1>
	<p>11/28 Three questions (and answers) about what we learned so far:</p>
	<p> What are some more events we can use in event listeners? -------- Here is a chat gpt generated list of all the possible event listeners: </li>

	<p> Mouse Events:</p>

		<li>	click: Occurs when the mouse button is clicked.</li>
		<li>	mouseover: Triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element.</li>
		<li>	mouseout: Fired when the mouse pointer moves out of an element.</li>
		<li>	mousemove: Occurs when the mouse pointer moves.</li>
		<li>	mousedown: Triggered when a mouse button is pressed over an element.</li>
		<li>	mouseup: Fired when a mouse button is released over an element.</li>

	<p>Keyboard Events:</p>
		<li>	keydown: Occurs when a key is pressed down.</li>
		<li>	keyup: Triggered when a key is released.</li>
		<li>	keypress: Fired when a key is pressed.</li>
	
	<p>Form Events:</p>
		<li>	submit: Occurs when a form is submitted.</li>
		<li>	input: Triggered when the value of an <!input>, <!select>, or <!textarea> element changes.</li>
		<li>	change: Fired when the value of an input element changes and loses focus.</li>

	<p>Window Events:</p>
		<li>	load: Occurs when a resource and its dependent resources have finished loading.</li>
		<li>	resize: Triggered when the browser window is resized.</li>
		<li>	scroll: Fired when the document view or an element is scrolled.</li>
		
	<p>Focus Events:</p>
		<li>	focus: Occurs when an element receives focus.</li>
		<li>	blur: Triggered when an element loses focus.</li>

	<p>Media Events:</p>
		<li>	play: Occurs when the media begins to play.</li>
		<li>	pause: Fired when the media playback is paused.</li>
		<li>	ended: Triggered when the media has reached the end.</li>
		
	<p>Drag and Drop Events:</p>
		<li>	dragstart: Occurs when the user starts dragging an element.</li>
		<li>	drag: Fired when an element is being dragged.</li>
		<li>	dragend: Triggered when the user finishes dragging an element.</li>

<p> What are the advantages of using javascript over CSS? -------- They both have their advantages. CSS is used mostly for styling webpages while javascript is used for more interactive parts of webpages.</p>


<p> What is the difference between heading and p tags? -------- Headings show up a lot bigger than p tags. </p>

<h1> Twelfth Journal Entry </h1>
	<p>12/12 Today I created another project using for loops. I took inspiration from my code from my fourth project (the soccer ball project) and Ms. Josephs bird code. The project features repeated images of Lewandowski and Muller (players who played at my favorite soccer team). These images start out with an opacity of zero (invisible) but when they are hovered over, their opacity changes to one (they appear). On every image their is a number counter and there are 5000 in total.</p>
	<p> I'm also having trouble getting by website updated because there are problems with the new token I got on github.</p>

<h1> Thirteenth Journal Entry </h1>
	<p>12/19 Today (and yesterday in my lab with Molly) I finished up my last project of the year. I created a way for the user to rate the albums they want to listen to the most over the holidays. The albums to rate are all on the top of the page and you have to click to make a copy and paste it into the spot you want to. Therd is a podium for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd as well as banners for 5th, 6th, and 7th. Using event listeners, when you click on an album it stores your choice and when you click again on it makes a copy. The position of the pasted album is determined by the location of the mouse by creating the variables x and y, console logging them, and subtracting 50 pixels from each so that the mouse corresponds to the center of the album rather than the top left corner (the albums are 100px by 100px).  </p>
