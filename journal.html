		<h1>First Journal Entry</h1>
		
		<p> 9/22 Last class (9/19) we created a photo on Github and liked our Sublime Text code to them. It is really cool to be able to look up my own website online, even though there are nothing but Gifs and images on it. </p>
		<p> The steps to update my website online: </p>

		<ul>
			
			<li> First, open your terminal and navigate to your folder by typing "cd ./desktop/JoseSebas2023.github.io"</li>
			<li> Then we add our changes by typing "git add ."</li>
			<li> Commit changes by adding a message that describes your changes by typing "git commit -m "your message""</li>
			<li> Finally you launch online by typing "git push"</li>
		</ul>

	<h1> Second Journal Entry </h1>

	<p>9/26 Today we went over everthing we have learned thusfar this year. In case I forget anything, here is the link to a slideshow with all the code we learned: bit.ly/cs1-slides . We also made our person cards and linked them to our websites. Here is the link to mine: https://codepen.io/JoseSebas2023/pen/zYyjYdK

	Although the issue of my website not showing up online was resolved, the link to my journal page still doesn't work. 

	We also made our first project. Basically its just a bunch of bright boxes that hurt your eyes and change colors when you hover over them.
