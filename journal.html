		<h1>First Journal Entry</h1>
		
		<p> 9/22 Last class (9/19) we created a photo on Github and liked our Sublime Text code to them. It is really cool to be able to look up my own website online, even though there are nothing but Gifs and images on it. </p>
		<p> The steps to update my website online: </p>

		<ul>
			
			<li> First, open your terminal and navigate to your folder by typing "cd ./desktop/JoseSebas2023.github.io"</li>
			<li> Then we add our changes by typing "git add ."</li>
			<li> Commit changes by adding a message that describes your changes by typing "git commit -m "your message""</li>
			<li> Finally you launch online by typing "git push"</li>
		</ul>

	<h1> Second Journal Entry </h1>

	<p>9/26 Today we went over everthing we have learned thusfar this year. In case I forget anything, here is the link to a slideshow with all the code we learned: bit.ly/cs1-slides . We also made our person cards and linked them to our websites. Here is the link to mine: https://codepen.io/JoseSebas2023/pen/zYyjYdK

	<p> Although the issue of my website not showing up online was resolved, the link to my journal page still doesn't work. </p>

	<p>We also made our first project. Basically its just a bunch of bright boxes that hurt your eyes and change colors when you hover over them. </p>

	</p>

	<!-- end of second entry -->

	<h1> Third Journal Entry </h1>

	<p>10/3 Today we worked on an animation project and put our updated websites on github. I did a soccer ball on fire moving acrossed the screen and getting bigger as it does. 
	</p>

	<h1> Fourth Journal Entry </h1>

	<p>10/6 Today we worked for the whole class. I updated my projects and aboutme page. Next class Ms. Joesphs is putting our websites on the class page so I have some work to do over the weeking to finish everthing up. </p>

	<h1> Fifth Journal Entry </h1>

	<p>10/13 I sketched out a plan for my halloween jumpscare project. I'm going to make the user tap on a house door for trick or treating and when the door opens a scary clown comes out. Although I don't have a lot of code for the project yet I linked it to my projects page. </p>

	<!-- end of fifth entry -->

	<h1> Sixth Journal Entry </h1>
	<p>10/24 I was out last class because I was sick but I'm still not really behind because I already coded my jumpscare. Some other big news that I learned when I came back to school is that Jonthan joined our class which is hype. Its great to have someone in class who is actually good at computer science.</p>

	<p>In class we refined our jump scares. Mine is a house with text that says "click to trick or treat" but when you click a creepy clown appears and does an evil laugh. At home I worked on centering the clown when it appeared because it isn't as scary when it shows up on the side. I also tried many times to have the text change to "BOO!" when the clown appears, but I still don't know how. </p>

	<!-- end of sixth entry -->

	<h1> Seventh Journal Entry </h1>
	<p>10/27 In class we continued working on our jumpscares. I explained what it is in the last journal entry but now I will explain the code behind it. In my jumpscare, I have two divs, one for the trick or treat house and the other for the clown. I also have an event listener that changes that plays a clown laugh and changes the clown's opacity to 1 when the screen is clicked (the user will click the screen because there is text at the top that says "click to trick or treat"). </p>

	<p> In class we also watched Ms. Joseph's video on event listeners. Here are 3 of my questions about event listeners:</p>


	<ul>
		<li> What are all the different types of events? </li>
		<li> How do you determine whether the event listener applies for the whole code or just a part of it? </li>
		<li> Is an event listener basically just a if ___ then ___ function? (like in Scratch) </li>
	</ul>

<!-- end of seventh entry -->

<h1> Eighth Journal Entry </h1>
	<p>11/10 We used javascript to make a fourth project. I made a project about soccer balls that appear at every .5 second interval and disapear if you hover over them with your mouse. Soon we will be starting gratitude cards. Basically we just code something that says we are greatful for someone and send it to them. I'll probably make one for my parents.  </p>

<!-- end of eighth entry -->

	<h1> Ninth Journal Entry </h1>
	<p>11/14 A function in code is a recipe that does something. We define it by saying function name (input){output} </p>
	<p>I barely had time to start my graditude card because I was taking the 
	]AMC10 for most of the class time. I couldn't answer more than half the questions and I honestly almost fell asleep. </p>
